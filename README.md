# Bank-Data-Classifier-Exploration
This is a project for my Machine Learning/AI Certification Course. The project is semi-guided in analyzing a dataset concerning bank data to produce classification models.
In this project, I take a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing to generate some classification models in a business-like setting.
I esplain my process in creating and evaluating models before concluding with a recommended classifier and some next steps.
